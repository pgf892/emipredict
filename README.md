# EMI Default Risk Prediction

## Problem
Financial institutions need to assess loan default risk accurately to reduce credit losses while approving legitimate borrowers.

## Approach
- Cleaned and prepared structured financial data
- Engineered relevant features for credit risk modeling
- Trained a classification model on imbalanced data
- Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Results
The model demonstrates strong discriminatory power between default and non-default cases, making it suitable for early risk screening.

## Business Impact
Enables lenders to identify high-risk applicants early, improve approval decisions, and reduce non-performing assets.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
